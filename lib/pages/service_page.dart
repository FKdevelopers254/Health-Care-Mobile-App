Broadly, the major elements of postnatal care include:counseling and health education on recognition of danger signs and appropriate care-seeking (for both mother and newborn) counseling and health education on routine care practices such as exclusive breastfeeding and good thermal care practices dispensing and related counseling for routine preventive interventions (such as chlorhexidine for cord-stump care and postnatal iron supplementation) assessment and case-management and referral for any identified complications or risk conditions It is through the same contacts that we have opportunities to improve outcomes for both mother and newborn, so programs and services should focus on needed care for both. This more integrated perspective is reflected in the most recent guidance from the World Health Organization (see Resources below). Home visitation by community health workers has been promoted as a postnatal care strategy based on promising pilots in South Asia that demonstrated potential for reducing newborn deaths. However, it has proven difficult to achieve comparable benefits under more routine conditions at scale. With the marked increases in institutional deliveries seen in many settings in recent years, there is increasing attention being given to taking better advantage of the time before discharge to ensure delivery of key aspects of postnatal care. Challenges to taking optimal advantage of this contact include the very high volume of births in some centers and the common practice of early discharge. Follow-up visits to the health facility for postnatal care can provide an important opportunity to ensure assessment, care, and provision of important counseling. Suitable timing and content of such care will depend on the overall configuration of postnatal care services specific to the setting.'),

The evidence for cancer screening, however, is often contentious. A description and explanation of disagreements over the evidence for cervical, breast, and prostate screening may assist physicians, policymakers, and citizens faced with screening decisions and suggest directions for future screening research. There are particular issues to be aware of in the evidence base for each form of screening, which are summarized in this paper. Five tensions explain existing conflicts over the evidence: (1) data from differing contexts may not be comparable; (2) screening technologies affect evidence quality, and thus evidence must evolve with changing technologies; (3) the quality of evidence of benefit varies, and the implications are contested; (4) evidence about harm is relatively new, there are gaps in that evidence, and there is disagreement over what it means; and (5) evidence about outcomes is often poorly communicated. The following principles will assist people to evaluate and use the evidence: (1) attend closely to transferability; (2) consider the influence of technologies on the evidence base; (3) query the design of meta-analyses; (4) ensure harms are defined and measured; and (5) improve risk communication practices. More fundamentally, there is a need to question the purpose of cancer screening and the values that inform that purpose, recognizing that different stakeholders may value different things. If implemented, these strategies will improve the production and interpretation of the methodologically challenging and always-growing evidence for and against cancer screening.'),
